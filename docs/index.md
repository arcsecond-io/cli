# Arcsecond.io ?

Arcsecond.io is the Astronomical Observations Platform.

It is a unique and comprehensive cloud platform covering the complete observation's lifecycle,
for both individual astronomers and observatories, with a consistent set of capabilities:

(Note: the description below corresponds to the coming version V5 of Arcsecond planned for the next Solstice '24
in June).

- Explore: Use **Night Explorer** (a.k.a. iObserve) to easily identify which target are best suited for which night.
- Plan: Use our new **Night Plans** to carefully craft your future observing nights.
- Observe: Record your observing nights with **Night Logs**, and attach data to each observation.
- Store: Choose the industry-grade AWS-backed secured **Cloud Storage** of Arcsecond, or attach external ones.
- Distribute: Easily create **Data Packages** of your observations for sharing with peers or visiting observers.

Arcsecond is made by an astronomer for astronomers.
