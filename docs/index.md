# Welcome to the Arcsecond CLI documentation ðŸ”­

The Arcsecond Command-Line Interface (CLI) is an open-source utility 
giving access to multiple public and private resources through the 
communication with the remote service `api.arcsecond.io`.

Arcsecond.io is a unique and comprehensive cloud platform made by two 
astronomers, for astronomers aiming at providing all the necessary
resources and tools for making (professionals and amateur) astronomical
observations. More details can be found in the
[About Page](https://www.arcsecond.io/about).

The Arcsecond CLI is freely available on GitHub and can be used in two
ways:
* as a terminal command `arcsecond` ...
* as a Python module `from arcsecond import ArcsecondAPI` ...
